Inspired from the awesome tutorial on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vy5Dxu7vDs&amp;list=RDCMUCbXgNpp0jedKWcQiULLbDTA&amp;start_radio=1&amp;rv=5Vy5Dxu7vDs&amp;t=0 .


The agemt utilizes Reinforcement learning in a simple linear Q Neural network with only forward propagation to predict agent's move.

## Observations -

As we observe after playing 100+ games,model finally learns to play the game with good results.


## Ongoing work - 
- Improving the current model by fine tuning the neural network
- Implimant similar work in Black jack game.
